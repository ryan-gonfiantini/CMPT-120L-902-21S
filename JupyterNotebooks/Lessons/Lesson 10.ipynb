    "One of the greater things about Python is the fact that it has a ton of tools built into it naturally. Because of this Python is one of the best languages for creating command line applications (CLIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "A Command Line Interface (CLI) in a simplistic sense is a way for a user to interact with a command line script. This can be useful in the sense where you have a tool that you want to be more accessable to a user without having to know exactly how the code is written but you also don't want to go the lengths of having to write a Graphical User Interface (GUI).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python this is made a lot easier due in part to a couple of libraries built into Python itself. Two that we're going to talk about today are the logging library and the argparse library."
